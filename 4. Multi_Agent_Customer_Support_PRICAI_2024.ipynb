Keywords：Generative AI, Large-scale language models, Symbolic processing AI, Deductive reasoning solution methods, Economics mathematics Target audience for the tutorial: The target audience includes those interested in having ChatGPT solve math problems and university instructors teaching mathematics. The tutorial material is here1) 2). A brief introduction of the tutorial : In this research, we have explored the feasibility of using ChatGPT to solve economics and mathematics word problems and generate educational graphics as teaching materials. ChatGPT, an AI-based on statistical methods, (an AI-based interactive text understanding and generation tool) also leverages deductive reasoning capabilities derived from large-scale language model training to solve economics and mathematics problems by combining formulas deductively. This capability is further enhanced by incorporating AI for symbolic processing, such as Wolfram Cloud, allowing ChatGPT to provide perfect solutions to fundamental word problems without assistance. Additionally, ChatGPT can illustrate the deductive reasoning process as a graph, enabling the efficient generation of visual teaching aids. During the tutorial lecture, we presented how ChatGPT solves problems involving Lagrange multipliers, such as maximizing a production function subject to a cost constraint. ChatGPT can completely solve and graph the deductive reasoning process for bond pricing and fixed-rate housing loan problems in financial mathematics. We use these resultant graphs in our economics math courses at Gakushuin University (see [link]( https://www-cc.gakushuin.ac.jp/~20010570//kakenC2024/index.html). In the latter half of the tutorial, participants can let ChatGPT solve problems and draw deduction reasoning plan graphs. The necessary items for this are: ChatGPT-4 Python Jupyter Notebook with the Graphviz package (or Google Colaboratory) The math problems to be solved are (1) tiny sample problem (velocity of a car), (2) Lagrange multiplier problem (cost minimum problem), and (3) Housing loan problem with variable interest rates (0.5% to 1.8%). Recommended prompts will be provided as tutorial materials. If participants cannot have ChatGPT solve the math problem, they can run the pre-prepared Python Graphviz program to experience creating deductive reasoning graphs (see the short demo video).[link] https://www-cc.gakushuin.ac.jp/~20010570//kakenC2024/contents/tinydemo.mp4 In the first half, we will conduct a lecture, and in the second half, participants who wish to do so can experiment with creating the deductive reasoning graphs in the workshop.

Website : https://pkawwebsite.github.io/2024/ Workshop flyer Workshop #2 : The 9th Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents (LaCATODA2024) Introduction : The more human-like machine intelligence engineers develop, the more important is for them to be familiar with advances in fields traditionally focusing on humans — ethics, psychology, linguistics, or cognitive science. In the age of data explosion, advancing hardware and more powerful learning algorithms, it has been becoming obvious that we need to study mechanisms underlying what we call a natural dialog, how we track a conversation or what we remember. It is not enough to pay attention what information is conveyed but also how it is conveyed. For this reason we extend topics to knowledge-related topics to seek answers to questions like how an utterance can become harmful, amusing, beautiful or interesting. We aim to gather AI researchers who realize that in spite of current popularity of GenAI \"chatbots\", they are not really dialog systems and it is necessary to extend existing and propose new algorithms to perform natural conversation. We will call for papers regarding research not only on the latest trends but also on revisiting classic studies related to dialog and understanding, as the AI developments allow to utilize theories that had focused on human interaction and understanding in the past. The workshop intends to spark an interdisciplinary discussion on affect in dialog understanding and generation tasks.

Website : https://iweai.github.io/2024/home Workshop Flyer Workshop #4 : Representation Learning and Clustering (RLC’24) Introduction : Data clustering and representation learning are essential in data science, aiding in the exploration of massive datasets across fields like information retrieval, natural language processing, bioinformatics, recommender systems, and computer vision. However, traditional clustering methods struggle with the high dimensionality, noise, heterogeneity, and sparsity of data from modern applications, especially when data is collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views. This has led researchers to develop new deep clustering models, often relying on representation learning. These models embed original data into a low-dimensional latent space for clustering, either sequentially or jointly, to handle complex data more effectively. The primary goal of this workshop is to unite leading researchers and practitioners working on advanced deep unsupervised feature extraction and clustering models. The workshop aims to: 1. Present recent advances in representation learning and clustering methods, including multi-view clustering and semi-supervised learning. 2. Highlight potential applications that could inspire new deep approaches. 3. Explore benchmark data to better evaluate and study deep clustering models. 4. Compare the effectiveness of deep clustering models with classical approaches in terms of interpretability of clusters and scalability. The RLC workshop seeks to advance research at the intersection of representation learning and clustering, focusing on real-world data science challenges. It welcomes high-quality academic and practical papers on unsupervised graph representation learning for clustering and related work.

However, it produces also various kinds of waste and impacts to manage. Sustainability requires solving complex problems, often with hybrid AI architecture. In numerous cases knowledge is vital for successful innovation, facing environmental challenges, in smart cities, education and resource management, among others. Energy life cycle, optimization, and combination of renewable energies for sustainable powering and heating can be improved applying also Knowledge Management principles. Raising prices of natural gas drives growth in renewable energies. Industries like steel, glass, chemical manufacturing sites are they are looking for AI based control systems for the Grid connected micro-grids. Circular energy explores the heat generated by data centers and the waste steam for a sustainable environment as like creating fish farms or agricultural sites, or recreating cooling water, which are additional processes that demand AI-based scheduling using meteorological data. Clean energy solutions require evolution of manufacturing processes and holistic approach supported by rigorous analytics, high quality data and the recognition of infrastructure dependencies. In order to increase sustainability in agriculture, it is vital to incorporate green technologies into farming, e.g., renewable generation. However, there are significant challenges associated with enhancing the sustainability of agriculture. Organizers : Eunika Mercier-Laurent (This email address is being protected from spambots.

Reinforcement learning has since proven effective in learning efficient policies for large-scale optimization problems that are beyond the scalability of traditional algorithmic approaches. Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) as computational engines has given rise to a new paradigm: LLM-powered agents capable of addressing complex problems across various domains. This talk will explore our recent work within these three paradigms and offer insights into the development of scalable, efficient, and distributed artificial general intelligence.

Keynote Speaker 2 Presenter : Prof. Long Tran-Thanh, University of Warwick, UK Title: What happens if LLM Agents strategically behave? Abstract The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) based AI systems has been disruptive to many sectors of our lives, and soon they will act as autonomous agents on our behalf in dealing with complex real-world problems while interacting with other agents and humans. However, it is unclear that when multiple of these LLM agents interact with each other, how they would influence each other’s behaviour. This is especially true if they are programmed to be strategic (i.e., selfish, or malicious) on the behalf of their human owners/creators. These strategic behaviours, if not mitigated efficiently, will cause societal, financial, ethical, and safety disasters. In this talk, I will discuss a number of key research challenges and problems that need to be addressed to avoid such disasters. These include: (i) last round/last iterate convergence in non-cooperative multi-agent learning; (ii) efficient learning with limited verifications against strategic manipulators; and (iii) truthful machine learning. While it is still unknown how these challenges should be addressed in the multi-LLM-agent setting, I will demonstrate how this has been addressed within the multiagent research community for simpler agent models, drawing some intuitions for future work on LLM agents.

Keynote Speaker 3 Presenter : Prof. Sadao KUROHASHI, Kyoto University, Japan Title : From Data Platforms to Knowledge Infrastructure Abstract Abstract:Modern society is facing pressing issues, including environmental challenges, inequality, and regional conflicts. To resolve these complex societal problems, the concept of \"open science\" is essential, as emphasized at last year’s G7 meeting. In Japan, starting in 2025, all scientific papers resulting from publicly funded research, along with the associated data, will be required to be immediately accessible through open access.The National Institute of Informatics (NII) has been at the forefront of advancing Japan’s academic information infrastructure for many years. In 2017, NII embarked on the development of the NII Research Data Cloud―a platform for the publication, discovery, and management of academic information―which became operational in 2021. By 2022, the project evolved into a research data ecosystem, built in collaboration with numerous universities and research institutions. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive environment where papers, data, and computational resources are readily accessible across all fields of research.Recognizing the significant impact of generative AI on society and the need for a hub in Japan where large-scale language models (LLMs) can be developed and studied, NII spearheaded the formation of the LLM-jp study group in May 2023. The group, founded on principles of openness, began with approximately 30 researchers specializing in natural language processing and has since grown to over 1,800 participants from industry, government, and academia.In April 2024, NII further advanced this initiative by establishing the LLM R&D Center. By September 2024, the center had developed and released the world’s largest fully open LLM, featuring 172 billion parameters―on a scale similar to GPT-3.5. The center\\'s ongoing work also focuses on ensuring the reliability and transparency of these models.To address the complex societal challenges mentioned above, it is crucial not only to deepen academic research but also to foster collaboration across various disciplines, creating new cross-disciplinary knowledge. LLMs can play a pivotal role in these processes by interpreting data, interconnecting and systematizing knowledge, and laying the groundwork for a robust knowledge infrastructure. Short bio Sadao Kurohashi received a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Kyoto University in 1994. He is currently the Director-General of the National Institute of Informatics, Japan, and a Specially Appointed Professor at the Graduate School of Informatics at Kyoto University. His research interests include natural language processing, knowledge infrastructure, and open science. He received the 10th and 20th anniversary best paper awards from the Journal of Natural Language Processing in 2004 and 2014, respectively, the 2009 IBM Faculty Award, the 2010 NTT DOCOMO Mobile Science Award, and the 2017 Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education. Keynote Speaker 4 Presenter : Prof. Milind Tambe, Harvard University, USA Title : Foundation Models: Accelerating AI for Social Impact and Resource Optimization Abstract: For nearly two decades, my team’s work on AI for social impact (AI4SI) has focused on optimizing limited resources in public health, conservation, public safety, and other critical areas. I will highlight recent results from our work in India on using bandit algorithms to improve effectiveness of the world’s two largest mobile health programs for maternal and child care that have served millions of beneficiaries, and previous work on influence maximization for HIV prevention among youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Deploying end-to-end AI4SI systems pipeline requires us to work with non-profits or government agencies repeating three steps of understanding their resource allocation challenges, building a tailored model and testing in the field. I\\'ll explore how we can leverage advancements in foundation models and LLMs to accelerate this process. I\\'ll share initial results on building such accelerators that in the future may help rapidly develop and deploy AI4SI solutions. Short bio Milind Tambe is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Director of Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University; concurrently, he is also Principal Scientist and Director for \"AI for Social Good\" at Google Deepmind.

He is a fellow of AAAI and ACM. Keynote Speaker 5 Presenter : Prof. Noa Garcia, Osaka University, Japan Title : Social Stereotypes in Generative Models Abstract: Generating images from textual descriptions requires the generative model to make implicit assumptions about the output scene that are not explicitly instructed in the input prompt. These assumptions can reinforce unfair stereotypes related to gender, race, or socioeconomic status. However, measuring and quantifying these social biases in generated images is a big challenge. In this talk, we will explore methods for measuring gender bias in text-to-image models, particularly Stable Diffusion, and discuss how the generated images, when used to train future computer vision models, affect bias in downstream tasks.

      "Dear Adhi Setiawan,\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much for reaching out! I truly appreciate your interest in exploring diffusion models, and I'm thrilled to provide you with some insightful details.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview of Diffusion Models\n",
      "\n",
      "**History**: Diffusion models have gained significant traction in recent years, particularly as powerful tools for generating synthetic data. They emerged as a more versatile and effective alternative to traditional generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). The concept revolves around gradually transforming a simple noise distribution into more complex data distributions through a process akin to diffusion in physical systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Theoretical and Conceptual Aspects**: At a theoretical level, diffusion models work by defining a stochastic process through which data is generated. The fundamental principle involves starting with a sample of random noise and iteratively refining it towards a target distribution, effectively reversing a diffusion process. This results in outputs that resemble the training data's structure and distribution. Unlike GANs, diffusion models avoid issues related to mode collapse and can generate higher-quality, diverse outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation using PyTorch\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simplified implementation of a diffusion model using PyTorch:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import torch\n",
      "import torch.nn as nn\n",
      "\n",
      "class SimpleDiffusionModel(nn.Module):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, input_dim):\n",
      "        super(SimpleDiffusionModel, self).__init__()\n",
      "        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, input_dim)\n",
      "\n",
      "    def forward(self, x):\n",
      "        # Simple forward pass to simulate diffusion\n",
      "        return self.linear(x) + torch.randn_like(x) * 0.1  # Adding noise\n",
      "\n",
      "# Simulating data generation\n",
      "model = SimpleDiffusionModel(input_dim=784)  # Assume input_dim is 784 (e.g., for flattened 28x28 images)\n",
      "num_samples = 1000\n",
      "random_noise = torch.randn(num_samples, 784)\n",
      "generated_data = model(random_noise)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Here, 'generated_data' would contain samples approximating the training data distribution.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This snippet is a very basic demonstration of how you can start building a diffusion model. Of course, refining these implementations to suit real datasets will require additional complexity, such as crafting more sophisticated neural networks and training protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Resources\n",
      "If you're looking to delve deeper, I recommend exploring the following resources:\n",
      "- [Tutorial on Diffusion Models](https://pricai.org/2024/index.php/programs/tutorials) at PRICAI 2024, which will provide hands-on experience.\n",
      "- The [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) for help with the implementation of neural network models.\n",

Keywords：Generative AI, Large-scale language models, Symbolic processing AI, Deductive reasoning solution methods, Economics mathematics Target audience for the tutorial: The target audience includes those interested in having ChatGPT solve math problems and university instructors teaching mathematics. The tutorial material is here1) 2). A brief introduction of the tutorial : In this research, we have explored the feasibility of using ChatGPT to solve economics and mathematics word problems and generate educational graphics as teaching materials. ChatGPT, an AI-based on statistical methods, (an AI-based interactive text understanding and generation tool) also leverages deductive reasoning capabilities derived from large-scale language model training to solve economics and mathematics problems by combining formulas deductively. This capability is further enhanced by incorporating AI for symbolic processing, such as Wolfram Cloud, allowing ChatGPT to provide perfect solutions to fundamental word problems without assistance. Additionally, ChatGPT can illustrate the deductive reasoning process as a graph, enabling the efficient generation of visual teaching aids. During the tutorial lecture, we presented how ChatGPT solves problems involving Lagrange multipliers, such as maximizing a production function subject to a cost constraint. ChatGPT can completely solve and graph the deductive reasoning process for bond pricing and fixed-rate housing loan problems in financial mathematics. We use these resultant graphs in our economics math courses at Gakushuin University (see [link]( https://www-cc.gakushuin.ac.jp/~20010570//kakenC2024/index.html). In the latter half of the tutorial, participants can let ChatGPT solve problems and draw deduction reasoning plan graphs. The necessary items for this are: ChatGPT-4 Python Jupyter Notebook with the Graphviz package (or Google Colaboratory) The math problems to be solved are (1) tiny sample problem (velocity of a car), (2) Lagrange multiplier problem (cost minimum problem), and (3) Housing loan problem with variable interest rates (0.5% to 1.8%). Recommended prompts will be provided as tutorial materials. If participants cannot have ChatGPT solve the math problem, they can run the pre-prepared Python Graphviz program to experience creating deductive reasoning graphs (see the short demo video).[link] https://www-cc.gakushuin.ac.jp/~20010570//kakenC2024/contents/tinydemo.mp4 In the first half, we will conduct a lecture, and in the second half, participants who wish to do so can experiment with creating the deductive reasoning graphs in the workshop.

PKAW 2024 will continue the above focus and welcome the contributions to the multi-disciplinary approach of human and big data-driven knowledge acquisition and AI techniques and applications. AI is changing the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their processes, products, and services. Also, in our daily life, AI-embedded devices such as smart speakers are about to become widely used, which extends the possibility of acquiring knowledge from users’ behavior observed through the interaction between those devices and their users. Knowledge acquisition and learning from big data are becoming more challenging than ever. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human experts but also from heterogeneous data. Multidisciplinary research, including knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-computer interaction, etc., is required to meet the challenge. We invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these areas. Organizers : Shiqing Wu, University of Technology Sydney, Australia (This email address is being protected from spambots.

Website : https://pkawwebsite.github.io/2024/ Workshop flyer Workshop #2 : The 9th Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents (LaCATODA2024) Introduction : The more human-like machine intelligence engineers develop, the more important is for them to be familiar with advances in fields traditionally focusing on humans — ethics, psychology, linguistics, or cognitive science. In the age of data explosion, advancing hardware and more powerful learning algorithms, it has been becoming obvious that we need to study mechanisms underlying what we call a natural dialog, how we track a conversation or what we remember. It is not enough to pay attention what information is conveyed but also how it is conveyed. For this reason we extend topics to knowledge-related topics to seek answers to questions like how an utterance can become harmful, amusing, beautiful or interesting. We aim to gather AI researchers who realize that in spite of current popularity of GenAI \"chatbots\", they are not really dialog systems and it is necessary to extend existing and propose new algorithms to perform natural conversation. We will call for papers regarding research not only on the latest trends but also on revisiting classic studies related to dialog and understanding, as the AI developments allow to utilize theories that had focused on human interaction and understanding in the past. The workshop intends to spark an interdisciplinary discussion on affect in dialog understanding and generation tasks.

Website : https://iweai.github.io/2024/home Workshop Flyer Workshop #4 : Representation Learning and Clustering (RLC’24) Introduction : Data clustering and representation learning are essential in data science, aiding in the exploration of massive datasets across fields like information retrieval, natural language processing, bioinformatics, recommender systems, and computer vision. However, traditional clustering methods struggle with the high dimensionality, noise, heterogeneity, and sparsity of data from modern applications, especially when data is collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views. This has led researchers to develop new deep clustering models, often relying on representation learning. These models embed original data into a low-dimensional latent space for clustering, either sequentially or jointly, to handle complex data more effectively. The primary goal of this workshop is to unite leading researchers and practitioners working on advanced deep unsupervised feature extraction and clustering models. The workshop aims to: 1. Present recent advances in representation learning and clustering methods, including multi-view clustering and semi-supervised learning. 2. Highlight potential applications that could inspire new deep approaches. 3. Explore benchmark data to better evaluate and study deep clustering models. 4. Compare the effectiveness of deep clustering models with classical approaches in terms of interpretability of clusters and scalability. The RLC workshop seeks to advance research at the intersection of representation learning and clustering, focusing on real-world data science challenges. It welcomes high-quality academic and practical papers on unsupervised graph representation learning for clustering and related work.

However, it produces also various kinds of waste and impacts to manage. Sustainability requires solving complex problems, often with hybrid AI architecture. In numerous cases knowledge is vital for successful innovation, facing environmental challenges, in smart cities, education and resource management, among others. Energy life cycle, optimization, and combination of renewable energies for sustainable powering and heating can be improved applying also Knowledge Management principles. Raising prices of natural gas drives growth in renewable energies. Industries like steel, glass, chemical manufacturing sites are they are looking for AI based control systems for the Grid connected micro-grids. Circular energy explores the heat generated by data centers and the waste steam for a sustainable environment as like creating fish farms or agricultural sites, or recreating cooling water, which are additional processes that demand AI-based scheduling using meteorological data. Clean energy solutions require evolution of manufacturing processes and holistic approach supported by rigorous analytics, high quality data and the recognition of infrastructure dependencies. In order to increase sustainability in agriculture, it is vital to incorporate green technologies into farming, e.g., renewable generation. However, there are significant challenges associated with enhancing the sustainability of agriculture. Organizers : Eunika Mercier-Laurent (This email address is being protected from spambots.

Reinforcement learning has since proven effective in learning efficient policies for large-scale optimization problems that are beyond the scalability of traditional algorithmic approaches. Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) as computational engines has given rise to a new paradigm: LLM-powered agents capable of addressing complex problems across various domains. This talk will explore our recent work within these three paradigms and offer insights into the development of scalable, efficient, and distributed artificial general intelligence.

Keynote Speaker 2 Presenter : Prof. Long Tran-Thanh, University of Warwick, UK Title: What happens if LLM Agents strategically behave? Abstract The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) based AI systems has been disruptive to many sectors of our lives, and soon they will act as autonomous agents on our behalf in dealing with complex real-world problems while interacting with other agents and humans. However, it is unclear that when multiple of these LLM agents interact with each other, how they would influence each other’s behaviour. This is especially true if they are programmed to be strategic (i.e., selfish, or malicious) on the behalf of their human owners/creators. These strategic behaviours, if not mitigated efficiently, will cause societal, financial, ethical, and safety disasters. In this talk, I will discuss a number of key research challenges and problems that need to be addressed to avoid such disasters. These include: (i) last round/last iterate convergence in non-cooperative multi-agent learning; (ii) efficient learning with limited verifications against strategic manipulators; and (iii) truthful machine learning. While it is still unknown how these challenges should be addressed in the multi-LLM-agent setting, I will demonstrate how this has been addressed within the multiagent research community for simpler agent models, drawing some intuitions for future work on LLM agents.

Keynote Speaker 3 Presenter : Prof. Sadao KUROHASHI, Kyoto University, Japan Title : From Data Platforms to Knowledge Infrastructure Abstract Abstract:Modern society is facing pressing issues, including environmental challenges, inequality, and regional conflicts. To resolve these complex societal problems, the concept of \"open science\" is essential, as emphasized at last year’s G7 meeting. In Japan, starting in 2025, all scientific papers resulting from publicly funded research, along with the associated data, will be required to be immediately accessible through open access.The National Institute of Informatics (NII) has been at the forefront of advancing Japan’s academic information infrastructure for many years. In 2017, NII embarked on the development of the NII Research Data Cloud―a platform for the publication, discovery, and management of academic information―which became operational in 2021. By 2022, the project evolved into a research data ecosystem, built in collaboration with numerous universities and research institutions. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive environment where papers, data, and computational resources are readily accessible across all fields of research.Recognizing the significant impact of generative AI on society and the need for a hub in Japan where large-scale language models (LLMs) can be developed and studied, NII spearheaded the formation of the LLM-jp study group in May 2023. The group, founded on principles of openness, began with approximately 30 researchers specializing in natural language processing and has since grown to over 1,800 participants from industry, government, and academia.In April 2024, NII further advanced this initiative by establishing the LLM R&D Center. By September 2024, the center had developed and released the world’s largest fully open LLM, featuring 172 billion parameters―on a scale similar to GPT-3.5. The center\\'s ongoing work also focuses on ensuring the reliability and transparency of these models.To address the complex societal challenges mentioned above, it is crucial not only to deepen academic research but also to foster collaboration across various disciplines, creating new cross-disciplinary knowledge. LLMs can play a pivotal role in these processes by interpreting data, interconnecting and systematizing knowledge, and laying the groundwork for a robust knowledge infrastructure. Short bio Sadao Kurohashi received a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Kyoto University in 1994. He is currently the Director-General of the National Institute of Informatics, Japan, and a Specially Appointed Professor at the Graduate School of Informatics at Kyoto University. His research interests include natural language processing, knowledge infrastructure, and open science. He received the 10th and 20th anniversary best paper awards from the Journal of Natural Language Processing in 2004 and 2014, respectively, the 2009 IBM Faculty Award, the 2010 NTT DOCOMO Mobile Science Award, and the 2017 Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education. Keynote Speaker 4 Presenter : Prof. Milind Tambe, Harvard University, USA Title : Foundation Models: Accelerating AI for Social Impact and Resource Optimization Abstract: For nearly two decades, my team’s work on AI for social impact (AI4SI) has focused on optimizing limited resources in public health, conservation, public safety, and other critical areas. I will highlight recent results from our work in India on using bandit algorithms to improve effectiveness of the world’s two largest mobile health programs for maternal and child care that have served millions of beneficiaries, and previous work on influence maximization for HIV prevention among youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Deploying end-to-end AI4SI systems pipeline requires us to work with non-profits or government agencies repeating three steps of understanding their resource allocation challenges, building a tailored model and testing in the field. I\\'ll explore how we can leverage advancements in foundation models and LLMs to accelerate this process. I\\'ll share initial results on building such accelerators that in the future may help rapidly develop and deploy AI4SI solutions. Short bio Milind Tambe is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Director of Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University; concurrently, he is also Principal Scientist and Director for \"AI for Social Good\" at Google Deepmind.

He is a fellow of AAAI and ACM. Keynote Speaker 5 Presenter : Prof. Noa Garcia, Osaka University, Japan Title : Social Stereotypes in Generative Models Abstract: Generating images from textual descriptions requires the generative model to make implicit assumptions about the output scene that are not explicitly instructed in the input prompt. These assumptions can reinforce unfair stereotypes related to gender, race, or socioeconomic status. However, measuring and quantifying these social biases in generated images is a big challenge. In this talk, we will explore methods for measuring gender bias in text-to-image models, particularly Stable Diffusion, and discuss how the generated images, when used to train future computer vision models, affect bias in downstream tasks. Short bio Noa Garcia is an Associate Professor at the Institute for Advanced Co-Creation Studies, Osaka University, Japan. Originally from Barcelona, she moved to Japan in 2018, first as a postdoctoral researcher and then as a specially-appointed assistant professor at the Institute for Datability Science. She completed her Ph.D in multimodal retrieval and instance-level recognition at Aston University, United Kingdom, after earning her degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona.

      "### Overview of Diffusion Models\n",
      "\n",
      "**History**: Diffusion models are relatively new entrants in the landscape of generative modeling, gaining prominence as effective tools for generating synthetic data. They were designed as an alternative to traditional models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), overcoming challenges such as mode collapse. The principle behind diffusion models involves a stochastic process where a simple noise is iteratively transformed into more complex data, mimicking the diffusion process observed in physical systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Theoretical and Conceptual Aspects**: The core mechanism of diffusion models is their ability to start from random noise and progressively refine it to approximate the target data distribution. This reverse diffusion process allows them to generate samples that closely resemble the structure of the training data. A significant advantage of diffusion models is their ability to produce diverse and high-quality outputs due to their robust generative process.\n",

      "### Overview of Diffusion Models\n",
      "\n",
      "**History**: Diffusion models are relatively new entrants in the landscape of generative modeling, gaining prominence as effective tools for generating synthetic data. They were designed as an alternative to traditional models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), overcoming challenges such as mode collapse. The principle behind diffusion models involves a stochastic process where a simple noise is iteratively transformed into more complex data, mimicking the diffusion process observed in physical systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Theoretical and Conceptual Aspects**: The core mechanism of diffusion models is their ability to start from random noise and progressively refine it to approximate the target data distribution. This reverse diffusion process allows them to generate samples that closely resemble the structure of the training data. A significant advantage of diffusion models is their ability to produce diverse and high-quality outputs due to their robust generative process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation using PyTorch\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a simplified implementation of a basic diffusion model using PyTorch:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import torch\n",
      "import torch.nn as nn\n",

      "        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, input_dim)\n",
      "\n",
      "    def forward(self, x):\n",
      "        # Simple forward pass to simulate diffusion\n",
      "        return self.linear(x) + torch.randn_like(x) * 0.1  # Adding noise\n",
      "\n",
      "# Simulating data generation\n",
      "model = SimpleDiffusionModel(input_dim=784)  # Assume input_dim is 784 (e.g., for flattened 28x28 images)\n",
      "num_samples = 1000\n",
